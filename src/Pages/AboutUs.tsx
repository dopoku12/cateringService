   next three years, I leveraged my training and skills working for an assortment of high-end restaurants, of which included:Le Bouquet Restaurant (Aburi, Ghana) and La Palm Royal Beach Hotel (Labadi, Ghana).To broaden my prospects and opportunities,I relocated to the USA where I furthered my training at Montgomery College and Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts (with a Specialty in Baking & Pastry Art). With my unique background, experience and education,I was able to secure a prestigious position with Brock & Company as a Catering Associate, which I hold to-date. 

​

     It is from this background and trajectory that Dee’s Catering Services emerged.Prompted by my successes, experiences, and growth,I felt motivated to finally bring to fruition my long-held dream of owning and managing my own catering company. I desired to start a venture where I will not only be able to utilize my lived-experiences, which spans across two continents, but also have the freedom to bring my own unique perspective to the catering industry. A perspective rooted and inspired by my first training, home-style cooking.
